I know there are many bugs and quirks on my page. When i open the file locally through a 
browser, my profile img seems to render just fine. However when I go to the github pages link 
I see that it is not loading proporly. I have inspected it with the crome dev tools and 
can not seem to debug it. Another struggle I can not seem to figure out is why my 
background image does not work. As far as I can tell it is linked in proporly. I recognise 
that there is still alot of work todo on this page yet the more I try to debug, 
the worse it seems to get. I hope I can set up some office hours to look at this a little 
closer with someone who might be able to help me understand what it is that I am doing 
wrong here.
