                    <p>My name is George Raymond. I am a aspiring developer located in Los Angeles CA. 
                        I am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UCLA. My goal is to aquire a postition as a junior developer
                        upon completion of this program. In the past I have worked in various industries including sales and contracting. 
                        I first got into coding out of curiosity however i soon realized that learning to code is much more obtainable
                        than I previously thought. I then realized that it is very possible to make a career out of coding without a
                        degree in computer science. I am currently working on building a working knowledge of both front and back end technologies.
